## Abstract

My effort to port the [original MinMaxGD library] from **C++** to **Java**.

The port is uncomplete, the following parts were implemented:
* Monomials
* Polynomials
* Series
* Addition
* Multiplication
* Star operation
* Effective computation algorithms (canonization of series, etc)

The following useful parts **were not implemented**:
* Matrices
* Everything that was connected with matrices in any way
* Residuation (L/R)
* etc...

Experiment was to examine the performance, which has gone beyond. Java is too slow for that.
Or I were too stupid, LOL.

### This is a part of my **coursework 2012**. Sucessfully used in this tool: [minmaxgd-grapher-java]
